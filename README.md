# grug Box2D and raylib game

See [my blog post](https://mynameistrez.github.io/2024/02/29/creating-the-perfect-modding-language.html) for an introduction to the grug modding language.

## Running

1. Clone this repository and open it in VS Code.
2. Run `git submodule update --init` to clone the `grug.c` and `grug.h` files (for your own game you can just drop these files directly into your project).
3. Hit Ctrl+Shift+P in VS Code, select `Tasks: Run Task`, and then select `Generate Makefile`.
4. Hit F5 to run the program.
